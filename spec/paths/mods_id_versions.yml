    summary: Create Mod Version
    description: |
      Creates a mod version.

      The version ID must conform to the [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) standard. Any leading `v` or surrounding whitespace will be removed.

      The version's "unique key" is the combination of the version's ID, modloader, and Minecraft version.<br>
      That means there can be two versions with the same ID and modloader, but different Minecraft versions.<br>
      Likewise there can also be two versions with the same ID and Minecraft version, but different modloaders.<br>

      The `recommended` field is used to determine which version is stable, this is used for the [GET `/mods/:id/forge`](#/paths/~1mods~1:id~1forge/get) endpoint.<br>
      The `changelog` field is used to store the version's changelog (duh!), this is also used for the [GET `/mods/:id/forge`](#/paths/~1mods~1:id~1forge/get) endpoint.

      The dependencies are structured as such:
        - `id`: The dependency's unique ID.
        - `version`: The dependency's version.
        - `required`: Whether the dependency is required or not.
        - `side`: The dependency's side. This means that `"CLIENT"` means the dependency is only required on the client side,<br>
          `"SERVER"` means the dependency is only required on the server side,<br>
          `"BOTH"` is required both on the client and server.
        - `version`: The dependency's version or version range. See [NPM's semver](https://nodejs.dev/learn/semantic-versioning-using-npm) for more information.
