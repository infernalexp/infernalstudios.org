    Deletes a token.

    A token can only be deleted if it is not expired.<br>
    Expired tokens are automatically deleted every minute, there's no need to do it yourself.<br>
    If an expired token hasn't been deleted yet, it will be deleted when it's used.<br>
    A token can delete itself, and another token can delete it if it has the `"token:delete"` permission.<br>
    Only tokens belonging to the same user can delete each other.
