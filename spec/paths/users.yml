  summary: Create User
  description: |
    Creates a user.

    Users can only be created by other users with the `user:create` permission.<br>
    Newly created users automatically have the `passwordChangeRequested` flag.<br>
    The `password` field must not be hashed in any way, this is done by the server.
    It is recommended that you connect to the server through TLS (HTTPS) to prevent
    password sniffing.
