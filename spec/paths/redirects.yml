  summary: Create Redirect
  description: |
    Creates a redirect.

    The `path` field must be unique, as there's no way there can be two redirects at the same place.<br>
    The redirect logic discards leading and trailing slashes, so these are all the same:
      - `/example_path/`
      - `/example_path`
      - `example_path`
      - `example_path/`

    - token: ["redirect:create"]
