        Returns the status of the API. Make sure to parse the JSON response,
        and only validate the given fields, because more could be changed in
        the future.
      responses:

              schema:
                type: object
                required: ["status"]
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                    description: |
                      Only possible values are `"ok"` and `"maintainance"`.
                      This may change in the future.

                      If this value is `"maintainance"`, the API is undergoing
                      maintainance and other endpoints should not be expected
                      to work.
                example: { "status": "ok" }
